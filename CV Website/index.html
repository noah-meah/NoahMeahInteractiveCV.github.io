									<p>This project aimed to reduce food insecurity in Austin and Travis County to create a just and sustainable local food system. Through analyzing World Cafe Conversation data we identified problems in the system and potential actionable solutions to improve the infrastructure of the current food system. We presented our findings as a poster presentation at the Dell Medical School HLA Showcase in April 2024.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Measuring Dementia Care Partners' Fall Risk Management Behaviors: Development and Content Validation<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Meah, Noah poster_page-0001 (1).jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I co-developed the Fall Risk Management Scale (FRMS) to measure how care partners prevent falls in people living with dementia. Through rigorous content validation, we ensured that the scale was clear, relevant, and culturally appropriate. Ultimately, we hope that our research is able to guide the development of fall risk interventions for people with dementia. I presented my findings at the Longhorn Research Forum in April 2025 and the Dell Medical School HLA Showcase in April 2025. Additionally, I will present this research at the National GSA 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting in November 2025.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Addressing Food Insecurity and Inequity in Austin-Travis County Using Community-Based Participatory Research<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/C-18_Tran (1)_page-0001 (1).jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project aimed to support the transition of the Austin and Travis County Food Plan from conceptual recommendations to actionable solutions. Using a community-based participatory research model, we interviewed Community Advisory Committee members and conducted qualitative analyses to identify factors that could facilitate and strengthen the implementation phase. I presented my findings alongside my team at the Longhorn Research Forum in April 2025, the Dell Medical School HLA Showcase in April 2025, and the 7th Annual Interprofessional Health Showcase in April 2025 where we were awarded 1st place in Best Community Engagement Projects and 2nd place in Best Overall Interprofessional Health Projects.</p>
